Personal Portfolio:

This is my personal portfolio and my first independent web development project. It's the center piece to all of my projects, displaying my skills and abilities in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The initial motivation behind this projects was to create something truly on my own after I believed I had achieved a high enough level understanding of web development. In which I could (for the first time), apply everything that I've learned up until this point. After picturing what I wanted to include and implement in my head, the portfolio was created.

I still modify it to this day and I will continue to add everything I've learned on my web development journey!
